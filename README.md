# User Generator in Rust

This project is a simple Rust program that generates a university-style user account from a person's **name** and **surname**.

Please note that:
Vectors folder:
Codes in vectors folder is more advanced version of this project. In this folder we are using vectors to store data. And It is possible to add more than one user.

Functions folder:
Codes in functions folder is more easy to read logic of code. In these codes we using seperate functions for each action. It is more organized and easy to understand.

If you want to understand code use functions folder, if you want to see advanced version of this project use vectors folder.

The program:
- reads a user's name and surname from standard input,
- creates a username based on those values,
- generates two email addresses,
- stores the result in a `User` struct,
- saves the output into a `users.json` file.

## Features

- Takes user input from the terminal
- Automatically creates a username
- Generates:
  - `@fit.cvut.cz` faculty email
  - `@cvut.cz` general email
- Serializes data into JSON using `serde` and `serde_json`
- Basic duplicate username handling with a random number

## Project Structure

### `User`
This struct stores the final generated user data:
- `name`
- `surname`
- `username`
- `faculty_email`
- `general_email`

### `Input`
This struct is used for temporary input storage:
- `name`
- `surname`

### `input()`
This function:
- reads `name` and `surname` from terminal input,
- trims newline characters,
- returns an `Input` object.

### `username_creator(data: &mut Vec<String>) -> User`
This function:
- gets input from the user,
- creates a username using parts of the surname and name,
- converts the username to lowercase,
- checks if the username already exists,
- adds a random number if needed,
- creates a `User` object with generated emails,
- returns the final user.

## Username Logic

The username is created with this logic:
- take the first **up to 5 characters** from the surname,
- take the first **up to 3 characters** from the name,
- combine them,
- convert the result to lowercase.

Example:
- Name: `Rufat`
- Surname: `Azizzade`
- Username: `azizzruf`

Generated emails:
- `azizzruf@fit.cvut.cz`
- `azizzruf@cvut.cz`

## How to Run

### 1. Install Rust
Make sure Rust is installed on your system.

### 2. Add dependencies
Your `Cargo.toml` should include:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.9"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

### 3. Run the program

```bash
cargo run
```

### 4. Enter input
After running, type:
- first line: name
- second line: surname

Example:

```text
Rufat
Azizzade
```

## Output

The program prints the generated `User` object and saves it into:

```text
users.json
```

Example JSON output:

```json
{
  "name": "Rufat",
  "surname": "Azizzade",
  "username": "azizzruf",
  "faculty_email": "azizzruf@fit.cvut.cz",
  "general_email": "azizzruf@cvut.cz"
}
```

## Notes

- This is a beginner-friendly Rust project for practicing:
  - structs
  - functions
  - mutable references
  - JSON serialization
  - string handling
- The current duplicate check only works if usernames are actually stored in the `data` vector.
- Using string slicing with Unicode characters may cause issues. A safer version would use `.chars()`.
- Some parts of the code can still be improved for cleaner logic and stronger error handling.

## Possible Improvements

- Store multiple users in a `Vec<User>`
- Save and reload existing users from `users.json`
- Improve duplicate username generation with a loop
- Handle Unicode names safely
- Separate logic into modules
- Add tests

## Learning Goals

This project is useful for learning:
- Rust structs
- ownership and cloning
- input handling with `stdin`
- vectors and references
- file creation
- JSON serialization/deserialization
